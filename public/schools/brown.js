During almost 300 years of colonial rule, the Andean provinces were shared by the Republic of Spaniards and the Republic of Indians - two separate societies, one dominating and exploiting the other. Today the region remains in many ways colonial, as Quechua- and Aymara-speaking villagers face a Spanish-speaking state, as well as an ever-more-integrated world market, the pressures of neoliberal reform from international banks, and the melting of the Andean glaciers.",
