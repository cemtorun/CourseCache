We will study Latin American horror cinema considering works across time periods, national contexts, and directors. This course will ask the following questions: How does the genre express individual and national anxieties in the cultural, social, political and economic realms? To what degree does horror film serve as a social barometer that explores, negotiates, and at times reifies social anxieties about difference, identity, sexuality, normativity, repression, technology, the environment, etc.?",
